# eComDataInsights

## About

eComDataInsights is a data analysis project that explores e-commerce data through SQL queries and visualizations. The project aims to derive meaningful insights from e-commerce datasets and present them using Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The analysis is documented in a Jupyter Notebook, utilizing data from a Kaggle dataset.

## Queries Covered :-

#### Basic Queries

 * List all unique cities where customers are located.
 
 * Count the number of orders placed in 2017.

 * Find the total sales per category.
 
 * Calculate the percentage of orders that were paid in installments.
 
 * Count the number of customers from each state.

#### Intermediate Queries

 * Calculate the number of orders per month in 2018.
 
 * Find the average number of products per order, grouped by customer city.
 
 * Calculate the percentage of total revenue contributed by each product category.
 
 * Identify the correlation between product price and the number of times a product 
   has been purchased.
   
 * Calculate the total revenue generated by each seller, and rank them by revenue.
 
   

#### Advanced Queries   

 * Calculate the moving average of order values for each customer over their order 
   history.
   
 * Calculate the cumulative sales per month for each year.
 
 * Calculate the year-over-year growth rate of total sales.
 
 * Calculate the retention rate of customers, defined as the percentage of 
   customers who make another purchase within 6 months of their first purchase.

 * Identify the top 3 customers who spent the most money in each year.
 
## Features
